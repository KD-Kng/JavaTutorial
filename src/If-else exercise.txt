Question 1) Check whether a number is single digit, double digit or three digit number and then print if it's single, double or three digit number. If the number has more than 3 digits then print "invalid number". If the number is negative, then also print "Invalid number". You can create a variable and then assign any value of your choice and then test on that number. 

Question 2) Take marks for 6 subjects and then find the average of their marks. Then assign a grade to that student based on the average mark from the table below :
90+ = A+
85-90 = A
79-85 = A-
71-79 = B+
60-71 = B-
51-60 = B
Below = Fail
Test this for 5 students each having 6 subjects. Print the average and grade of each student. At last find and print the student who got the third highest grade for average marks.
